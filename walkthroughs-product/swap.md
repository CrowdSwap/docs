# Swap


Currently, you can swap (trade) the tokens which white listed by CrowdSwap.
CrowdSwap offers the possibility of swapping. Built on search, the transition to the Swap app is fluid and transparent.
CrowdSwap makes it particularly easy and transparent for the user. The latter does not have to worry about the exchange's technical challenges but can receive his traded tokens.
Based on best price routing (BPR), CrowdSwap takes care of all actions to successfully execute the swap and save on ancillary costs where possible.
These features increase user-friendliness and reduce complexity significantly.

Before doing the swap, you can see all the extra costs and fees on the right side of the swap panel transparently.
