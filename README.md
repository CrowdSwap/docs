# Introduction

The crypto space itself has ever since allowed people to make life-changing gains. With decentralized finance (Defi), the possibilities have increased a lot more. Every new project on the launch platforms, e.g., Polkastarter, did amazingly well afterward, sometimes reaching valuations of 100x or even more. In a bull market, everybody wants to trade these tokens that are available first on the decentralized exchanges\
(DEXes), e.g., Uniswap. Lately, the popularity of this business has created some problems itself. Network traffic exceeded former expectations. And especially Ethereum had to suffer from high transaction fees. These high transaction costs gave other network providers the chance to step in. With lower prices, they can make up to\
Ethereum is the number 1 network. Different chains bring another dimension of complexity to the Defi space. Now the amount of DEXes not only grows on Ethereum, but it also spreads across all kinds of networks. The majority of users can't keep track of all DEXes anymore. Not to mention the overhead of transferring their coins and tokens across networks. The future of Defi is bright, and CrowdSwap believes in Defi. The mentioned issues are to be solved to make Defi a place of equality for every human being.
