# VIP Score: Calculation Details

This page explains how the VIP Score is calculated and provides a breakdown of all factors involved.

## 1. Criteria and Score Multipliers

- **Hold CROWD:** 0.5
- **CROWD Stake:** 1
- **CROWD Locked Stake:** 1.5
- **CROWD in Opportunity:** 5
  - Notes:
    - CROWD in the Opportunity pool is multiplied by **5**.
    - Rewards earned from Opportunity are multiplied by **1**.
- **Cross-Chain Transactions:** 50
  - Notes:
    - Each cross-chain transaction contributes **50** (It means 50x The transaction's Dollar value).
    - Cross-Chain points are calculated daily and reset every day.

## 2. Rules for LTH (Long-Term Holders)

### Eligibility Criteria for LTH

- The **CROWD** bought and held until **August 21, 2022**, including those purchased during the **Private Sale** and **Public Sale**, will be considered as the **LTH Amount**.
- If **less than 10%** of this LTH Amount has been sold until today, you will be considered a **Long-Term Holder** (LTH).
- **LTH Point** represents the score for CROWD that you have bought and held until now.
- If you qualify as a Long-Term Holder (LTH), your total score will be calculated as: <br/>**Total Score = Score based on all your CROWDs (Holding, Staking, ...) + LTH Points**

## 3. VIP Rewards

### Cross-Chain Transaction Bonus

- VIP members share **0.5%** of the revenue generated from cross-chain transactions.
- The transactions must use liquidity from **CrowdSwap liquidity pools** and have **CROWD** as the intermediary token (CROWD Route).

#### Notes

- This excludes CROWD bridges, as most of the revenue from those transactions is allocated to liquidity pools as incentives, with another portion being burned.

### Profit Distribution

- Rewards are distributed **daily** to users based on their **VIP level** and activity.

#### VIP Program Levels

- **Bronze:** 20% revenue share
- **Silver:** 30% revenue share
- **Gold:** 50% revenue share

Your **VIP level** and the **number of points** you have within that level decide how much of the revenue share you receive.

#### Example

- Someone with **3 million points** in the **Gold** level might get **10%** of the **50%** revenue share for Gold.
- Someone with **9 million points** in the same level could get **30%** of the **Gold** revenue share.

#### Key Takeaway

- The more points you have, the bigger your share of the revenue!

## Key Notes

- All multipliers and formulas are applied automatically in the system.
- **CrowdSwap** does not currently generate 0.5% revenue from other routes, but in the future, we may be able to share that with VIP members as well.

## Additional Information

This page will be updated if there are any changes to the rules or score multipliers.
