# VIP Score: Calculation Details

This page explains how the VIP Score is calculated and provides a breakdown of all factors involved.

## 1. Criteria and Score Multipliers

- **Hold CROWD:** 0.5
- **CROWD Stake:** 1
- **CROWD Locked Stake:** 1.5
- **CROWD in Opportunity:** 5

#### Notes

- CROWD in the Opportunity pool is multiplied by 5.
- Rewards earned from Opportunity are multiplied by 1.
- **Cross-Chain Transactions:** 50 points.

#### Notes

- Each cross-chain transaction contributes 50 points.
- Cross-chain points are calculated daily and reset every day.

## 2. Rules for LTH (Long-Term Holders)

### Eligibility Criteria for LTH

- The CROWD bought and held until August 21, 2022, including those purchased during the Private Sale and Public Sale, will be considered as the LTH Amount.
- If less than 10% of this LTH Amount has been sold until today, you will be considered a Long-Term Holder (LTH).
- The LTH Amount will be doubled (multiplied by 2) and added to your points.

#### Important

- This 2x multiplier only applies to the LTH Amount, not to all your CROWD.

### Example

#### Your Score without LTH Point:

(CROWD in Wallet + CROWD in Stake + CROWD in Opportunity – LTH Amount) + 4 × CROWD in Opportunity + Reward from Opportunity

Example Calculation:
(100,000 + 1,000,000 + 150,000 – 250,000) + 4 × 150,000 + 10,000 = 1,610,000

#### Your Score with LTH Point:

Your Score without LTH Point + (2 × LTH Amount)

Example Calculation:
1,610,000 + (2 × 250,000) = 2,110,000

#### Point

In this example, the net **LTH Amount** (CROWD bought and held until August 21, 2022) is **250,000**, which was first deducted from the overall CROWD balance to calculate the total score without the LTH Point. Then, the LTH Amount was multiplied by **2** and added to the VIP score.

## 3. VIP Rewards

### Cross-Chain Transaction Bonus

- VIP members share **0.5%** of the revenue generated from cross-chain transactions.
- The transactions must use liquidity from **CrowdSwap liquidity pools** and have **CROWD** as the intermediary token (CROWD Route).

#### Notes

- This excludes CROWD bridges, as most of the revenue from those transactions is allocated to liquidity pools as incentives, with another portion being burned.

### Profit Distribution

- Rewards are distributed **daily** to users based on their **VIP level** and activity.

#### VIP Program Levels

- **Bronze:** 20% revenue share
- **Silver:** 30% revenue share
- **Gold:** 50% revenue share

Your **VIP level** and the **number of points** you have within that level decide how much of the revenue share you receive.

#### Example

- Someone with **3 million points** in the **Gold** level might get **10%** of the **50%** revenue share for Gold.
- Someone with **9 million points** in the same level could get **30%** of the **Gold** revenue share.

#### Key Takeaway

- The more points you have, the bigger your share of the revenue!

## Key Notes

- All multipliers and formulas are applied automatically in the system.
- **CrowdSwap** does not currently generate 0.5% revenue from other routes, but in the future, we may be able to share that with VIP members as well.

This page will be updated if there are any changes to the rules or score multipliers.
